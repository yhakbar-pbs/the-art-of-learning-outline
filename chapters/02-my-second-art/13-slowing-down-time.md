# Slowing Down Time

* A lot of this chapter has to do with _chunking_ and _carved neural pathways_
* Chunking - technical psychology term for abstracting groups of information by patterns or principles
* Carved neural pathways - I think this is Josh discussing a metaphorical version of myelination and neuroplasticity
