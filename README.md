# The Art of Learning Outline

## Summary

Josh Waitzkin is a talented competitor, and attributes a good deal of his success to being able to learn efficiently and holistically. He makes the argument in The Art of Learning that in order to be truly great, one has to convert the practice they engage in from proficiency of a skill to self expression of their essence.

This is a highly esoteric book, with intuition and metaphor used instead of scientific justification. Although largely focused on competitive performance, there's also a lot of good insight into personal performance and learning.
